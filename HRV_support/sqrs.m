% Usage:
%       fid = sqrs(ecg,debug)
%
% fid = sample points of onset of each QRS complex.
% ecg = single channel of ECG sampled at approximately 256Hz.
%
% (use resample.m  if you have a significantly different sampling frequency.)
%
% if debug>0, then plot final data (default; debug=0)
% 
% This algorithm is sensitive to high frequency noise, so you 
% might want to use an FIR band-pass filter first.

%
% The detector algorithm is based on example 10 in the WFDB
% Programmer's Guide, which in turn is based on a Pascal program
% written by W.A.H. Engelse and C. Zeelenberg, "A single scan
% algorithm for QRS-detection and feature extraction", Computers in
% Cardiology 6:37-42 (1979).  `sqrs' does not include the feature
% extraction capability of the Pascal program.  The output of `sqrs'
% is an annotation file (with annotator name `qrs') in which all
% detected beats are labelled normal;  the annotation file may also
% contain `artifact' annotations at locations which `sqrs' believes
% are noise-corrupted.
%
% 'sqrs' has been optimized for adult human ECGs. For other ECGs,
% it may be necessary to experiment with the input sampling
% frequency and the time constants indicated below. 
%
% This program is provided as an example only, and is not intended
% for any clinical application.  At the time the algorithm was
% originally published, its performance was typical of
% state-of-the-art QRS detectors.  Recent designs, particularly
% those that can analyze two or more input signals, may exhibit
% significantly better performance.
