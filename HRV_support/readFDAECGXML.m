% [vec lead sf] = readFDAECGXML(filename);
% 
% Reads FDA XML ECG data. 
% vec is a matrix containing all the ECG leads
% lead is a set of strings describing the leads (same dim as vec)
% sf{1} is the sampling interval (1/sampling freq) - hopefully.
%
% Try plotting the data with:
% for(i=1:length(lead));plot(vec2a(:,i));title(['lead ' lead{i}]);pause;end
