%   Calculates the Lomb-Scargle normalized periodogram values 
%   "Px" as a function of the supplied vector of frequencies 
%   "freq" for input vectors "t" (time) and "x" (observations).
%   Also returns the probability "Prob" that the null hypothesis
%   is valid (same length as Px and freq). Time stamps, t and 
%   amplitudes "x" must be the same length.
